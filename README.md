# üîê Share 1Password

## What is it?

**Securely share notes with others using 1Password. Perfect for developers sending credentials to clients.**

I often find myself needing to send `.env` files, credentials, and other sensitive information to others, in particular team members or clients. I would like something as simple as:

1. I pipe the file with the text to share into the CLI program üöÄ

2. A secure link to share is copied to my clipboard üìã

3. Simple as that. There is no step 3 ‚úÖ

**So I wrote just that! üéâ**

In my opinion, 1Password is the single best password manager out there, so I based my implementation on their CLI.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have [1Password](https://1password.com/) installed on your machine.

Next, in the 1Password application, navigate to **Preferences** > **Developer**. Enable the **Integrate with 1Password CLI** option.

Also ensure you have the 1Password CLI installed. Refer to the [installation guide](https://support.1password.com/command-line-getting-started/) for more information.

### Using Cargo

Ensure you have `cargo` installed. Then, run the following command:

```bash
# Install the application
cargo install share-1password
```

## Usage

Ensure you have `share-1password` installed. Then, run the following commands:

```bash
# Navigate to the directory with the note you want to share, e.g. a `.env` file
cd <directory>

# Pipe the file into the application with default settings
cat <file> | share-1password

# Use `--help` to see all available options
share-1password --help

# Use `--vault` to specify the vault to store the note in
cat <file> | share-1password --vault <vault-name>

# Use `--emails` to specify the emails to share the note with. Default to anyone with the link.
cat <file> | share-1password --emails <email1> <email2> <email3>
```

‚úÇÔ∏è Note that `share-1password` automatically copies the link of the shared note to your clipboard.

You can now share this link securely with others, for instance using email, Slack, or any other messaging platform.
